# Wolfram Language Geospatial Analytics

This folder contains Wolfram Language (.wls) scripts used for geospatial analysis and data processing.

## Files

- *build_geometry.wls**: Builds county geometry for spatial analysis
- **export_layers.wls**: Exports map layers for visualization
- **model_fit.wls**: Fits statistical models with geospatial components
- **prep_data.wls**: Prepares and processes geospatial data

These scripts were essential for calculating interstate proximity distances, county centroids, and other geospatial metrics used in the analysis.
